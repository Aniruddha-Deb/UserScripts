# UserScripts

As Chrome outlaws Manifest v2, I've moved to Firefox, and instead of making new plugins all over again, I've decided to migrate to UserScripts. It's much easier and works like a charm, without the fuss of creating and saving a plugin to disk.

Impartus plugins have not been migrated, as online classes are a thing of the past now.
